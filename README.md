# Welcome to terraform-lab! ðŸ‘‹

At terraform-lab, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern tech stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with simple backend framework for small projects, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

* **[test](https://github.com/terraform-lab/test)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast test library. âœ¨

Beyond test, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas:

* vitest.config.js optimization
* deserialization integration
* Developer experience tools
* Performance monitoring

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline development.
